# Sierpinski Ledger

## Project Overview
Sierpinski Ledger is a FastAPI-based API server designed to facilitate transactions on a blockchain-like structure. The project aims to provide functionality for creating, verifying, and managing transactions using a Sierpinski fractal as a structure for wallets. It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the ledger, enabling tasks such as adding transactions, querying balances, and exporting or importing the ledger state. 

## Installation
To get started with Sierpinski Ledger, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Once it's set up, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sierpinski-ledger.git
   cd sierpinski-ledger
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
   ```

4. Optionally, install other libraries needed to run the application if they are part of the project.

## Usage
### Starting the API Server
To run the FastAPI server, execute the following command:
```bash
uvicorn api_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your browser to access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI).

### Using the CLI Tool
The command-line interface provides various commands:
- **Add Transaction**: 
    ```bash
    python cli.py add-transaction --sender <sender_wallet> --receiver <receiver_wallet> --amount <amount>
    ```
- **Query Transactions**: 
    ```bash
    python cli.py query-transactions --wallet <wallet_address>
    ```
- **Get Balance**: 
    ```bash
    python cli.py get-balance --wallet <wallet_address>
    ```
- **Verify Ledger**: 
    ```bash
    python cli.py verify-ledger
    ```
- **Visualize Ledger**: 
    ```bash
    python cli.py visualize-ledger
    ```
- **Export Ledger**: 
    ```bash
    python cli.py export-ledger --file <filename>
    ```
- **Import Ledger**: 
    ```bash
    python cli.py import-ledger --file <filename>
    ```

Refer to the CLI command help for detailed usage by running:
```bash
python cli.py --help
```

## Features
- **CORS support**: Cross-origin requests are handled with proper middleware configuration.
- **Transaction Management**: Add and view transactions in the ledger.
- **Wallet Balance Inquiry**: Check the balance of a specific wallet.
- **Ledger Verification**: Verify the state of the ledger for integrity.
- **Founder and Standard Onboarding**: Special endpoints to facilitate onboarding processes.
- **Command-line Interface**: A CLI for easy interaction with the ledger functionalities.
